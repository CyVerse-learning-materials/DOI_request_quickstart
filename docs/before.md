# 1. Before you start

## Background

CyVerse Curated Data in the Data Commons contains files that have been
assigned a permanent identifier ( ). These files are secure, stable, and
unchangeable, thus making them the ideal platform for ease of data reuse
and data citation. Datasets in the CyVerse Curated Data site can store
very large datasets that are difficult to transfer, upload, and download
across different computers and platforms. CyVerse Curated data is
accessible to CyVerse\'s suite of large-scale computational analysis
resources, allowing users to seamlessly analyze, manage, and publish new
results.
