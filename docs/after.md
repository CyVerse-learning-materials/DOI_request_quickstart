# 5. After publication

## 5.1. Get your dataset noticed.

Metadata, the description about your data, is key to getting your dataset noticed in the world wide web. Search engines and bibliographic aggregators index the metadata that you create to obtain a DOI. Thus, it is important that you do the following:

-   Make sure the metadata are complete.
-   Include precise keywords in the "Subject" attribute. - Include
    descriptive terms about the science and themes involved in your
    research. These can go in the "Subject" attribute, but you can
    also create additional metadata attributes specific to your
    dataset.
-   Include methods used to generate the dataset in the
    "Description" attribute, and in more detail in a Readme file.
-   Describe the dataset for a broader audience so that they
    understand your research. Use the "Description" field for
    this.
-   If you or team members have an ORCID ID, make sure to include it
    in the metadata.

## 5.2. Publicize your dataset:

-   Consider using social media to share the DOI of your dataset, and
    tag CyVerse.
-   If you have an interesting story about your data, contact us at
    <doi@cyverse.org>, and we may be able to share it through CyVerse
    outreach.
-   If you have a tool or workflow you developed to analyze your data in
    CyVerse, consider presenting it as part of our Focus Forums webinars
    series.
