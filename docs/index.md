# DOI Request Quickstart

## Goal

This quickstart provides the basic steps for organizing your data and
requesting a DOI.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Before you start

CyVerse Curated Data in the Data Commons contains files that have been
assigned a permanent identifier ([DOI](https://www.doi.org/)). These files are secure, stable, and
unchangeable, thus making them ideal subjects for ease of data reuse
and data citation. CyVerse Curated Data can store
very large datasets that are difficult to transfer, upload, and download
across different computers and platforms. You can access CyVerse Curated Data from
CyVerse's suite of large-scale computational analysis
resources, allowing you to seamlessly analyze, manage, and publish new
results.
