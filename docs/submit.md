# 3. Submit request and wait for validations

## 3.1. Submit DOI request

-   In the Data tab, click the checkbox next to the folder.
-   Select More actions \> Request DOI.
-   After verifying you have read the instructions (i.e. this guide),
    click \"I need a DOI\". You will receive a verification email that
    your request has been received, and a notification will be listed in
    the Notifications list in the DE.

> **Note:** At this point, your folder will move to a new location under Community_Data/commons_repo/staging.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3.2. Validations

-   After submitting your request, a CyVerse Curated Data curator begins
    validating your dataset, metadata, and overall configuration of your
    dataset.
-   Validations are based solely on the required DOI metadata and
    folder-naming conventions, as well as its potential utility to the
    CyVerse and larger scientific community, not the quality of your
    data. This is not a peer review process.

> #### Possible validation actions:
>
> - If the curator determines that minor changes are needed, they
> may make those changes themselves.
> - If the curator determines that substantive changes are needed,
> they will contact you with required changes.
> - If the curator determines that your dataset is not appropriate
> for the Curated Data section of the Data Commons (e.g., because
> it belongs in NCBI), you will be notified.
> -  If the curator determines that the dataset is adequately
> organized and the DataCite metadata are accurate, they will
> provide a DOI, and you will be notified of the DOI and the final
> dataset location.


> #### Tip
> To check the status of your request, click Notifications (the bell icon) at the top right of the DE screen. For more information on using notifications in the DE, see.
