4. Submit request and wait for validations
-------------------------------------------

4.1. Submit DOI request
========================

- In the Data window, click the checkbox next to the folder.
- Select Metadata > Request DOI.
- After verifying you have read the instructions (i.e. this guide), click "I need a DOI". You will receive a verification email that your request has been received, and a notification will be listed in the Notifications list in the DE.	

.. note::
	At this point, your folder will move to a new location under Community Data/commons_repo/staging.

-----
	
4.2. Validations
========================

- After submitting your request, a CyVerse Curated Data curator begins validating your dataset, metadata, and overall configuration of your dataset. 
- Validations are based solely on the required DOI metadata and folder-naming conventions, as well as its potential utility to the CyVerse and larger scientific community, not the quality of your data. This is not a peer review process.

**Possible validation actions:**
	- If the curator determines that minor changes are needed, they may make those changes themselves.
	- If the curator determines that substantive changes are needed, they will contact you with required changes.
	- If the curator determines that your dataset is not appropriate for the Curated Data section of the Data Commons (e.g., because it belongs in NCBI), you will be notified.
	- If the curator determines that the dataset is adequately organized and the DataCite metadata are accurate, they will provide a DOI, and you will be notified of the DOI and the final dataset location.

.. tip::
	To check the status of your request, click Notifications (the bell icon) at the top right of the DE screen. For more information on using notifications in the DE, see |Viewing and Deleting Notifications|.
