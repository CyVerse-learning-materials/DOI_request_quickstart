Search for an answer: CyVerse Learning Center Learning Center Home","title":"Additional information, help"},{"location":"doi_faq/","text":"Learning Center Home DOI Frequently Asked Questions \u00b6 Why should I publish my data in CyVerse Curated Data? \u00b6 CyVerse Curated Data is the ideal platform for ease of data reuse. Because it is assigned a permanent identifier (DOI or ARK), it is stable and unchangeable, making it ideal for data citation. Because the data is stored in large-scale storage resources that are monitored 24/7, it is secure. Because it allows transfer, upload, and download across different computers and platforms, it can store very large datasets. And because its data is accessible to CyVerse's suite of large-scale computational analysis resources, users can seamlessly analyze, manage, and publish new results. For more information, see Is CyVerse Curated Data Right for My Data? . What are the conditions for data to be published through CyVerse Curated Data? \u00b6 Several conditions must exist in your data before it can be published in CyVerse Curated Data: You must be a registered CyVerse account holder. To register for an account, see the Create Accoun Quickstart . A dataset may be up to 100GB in size. If you are interested in depositing a larger dataset, please request an increased data allocation before requesting a permanent identifier using this form . Data must be both curated and static. Once the data is published, it cannot be amended (although newer versions can be published). Data must be organized to identify the different components (raw, preprocessed, analysis, etc.). Compressed files must be in LASzip or open-source Gzip family of compression formats including zip, tar, tar.gz, or tgz. At minimum, the dataset must include a complete description according to the DataCite standard . Domain-specific schemas, however, and the addition of ReadMe files, publications, or help notes that explain the data as well as how they were obtained and can be used, are encouraged. In organizing and documenting the data, users should ask themselves, \"What would someone need to reuse this data?\" Can I publish to the Data Commons if my data is not static and curated by CyVerse? \u00b6 Yes, you can make data available to the public via Community Released Data. See Publishing Data through the Data Commons . What is a DOI ? \u00b6 A DOI is a Digital Object Identifier . It serves as a permanent, redirectable identifier and URL for your dataset, so that even if the location of your dataset changes, it can still be found with the same ID. DOIs are issued by CyVerse through the DataCite service. Do I need to contact CyVerse before requesting a DOI? \u00b6 The process of requesting a DOI is automated through the DE, but some process must be handled manually, such as DOIs for datasets with more than 1000 files or DOIs for datasets that are stored somewhere other than /iplant/home/share/commons_repo/curated . If you match either of those cases, please contact us a doi@cyverse.org . Also contact us if you have questions about how to organize your data or what scientific metadata to include. How much does a CyVerse permanent identifier cost? \u00b6 At this point in time, CyVerse does not charge for DOIs. However, the dataset must meet the requirements on the page Is CyVerse Curated Data Right for My Data? . In the future, there may be a charge for issuing permanent identifiers in the CyVerse Data Commons. How long will it take to obtain a permanent identifier and publish my data? \u00b6 Providing that your dataset is in good order and ready to be published, the process may take up to one week, as it may involve a dialogue with the CyVerse data curators. If your data is well organized and the metadata is complete and accurate, the process will be much faster (usually 1-2 days). It is best to submit your request at least one week before you need the identifier (e.g., for a manuscript submission) or longer for very large of complex datasets. Can I publish different versions of my data? \u00b6 Yes. Each new version must be documented, and will be assigned a new permanent identifier that references the original dataset. For new versions, contact us at doi@cyverse.org . How small or big should my data be to be published? \u00b6 The size of the dataset is less important than its utility to the scientific community. Although there is no lower size limit for requesting a DOI or ARK, the default upper size limit for data allocations on CyVerse is 100GB. If you are interested in depositing a larger dataset, please request an increased data allocation before requesting a permanent identifier. What is the policy for submitting compressed data to CyVerse Curated Data? \u00b6 Certain file types are regularly transferred, stored, and used in applications in a compressed form, such as FASTQ for genomic data and LAZ for LIDAR data. Curated Data supports the deposition of files in the following open compressed formats: LASzip ( http://www.laszip.org/ ) and the open source Gzip ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gzip ) family of compression formats including zip, tar, tar.gz, or tgz. Can I publish data in CyVerse if I am not a CyVerse user? \u00b6 You need to have a CyVerse account to publish your data in the Data Commons repositories (Community Contributed or Curated Data). You do not have to be a user of the entire platform, but at minimum you must be able to upload data, add metadata, and use the Discovery Environment to request a DOI. If you have not used the DE's metadata features before, start with Using Metadata in the DE and read the section on metadata templates. How secure is the data in the Curated Data site? \u00b6 Data in our platform is stored in large-scale storage resources that are monitored 24/7. Data is authenticated through checksum analysis at ingest, and is locally and geographically replicated so that if any one system fails there will always be a safe copy of your data. What is CyVerse Data Commons' long-term commitment to hosting public data? \u00b6 If and when the Data Commons cannot host your data in CyVerse Curated Data, it will transfer custody of the data to another repository and will change the target URL to which the identifier points. What if in the future I want to move my data to another repository? \u00b6 If you want to move your data to another repository, please send a ticket with the new DOI and URL location and we will change the DOI target. You may leave a copy of the dataset in the CyVerse Curated Data site for ease of reuse within the computational environment. We will update the metadata to reflect the relationship between the two identical datasets. How can I make it easier for people to give me (and my co-creators) credit for using my dataset? \u00b6 Encourage others to cite your data using the DOI. Each dataset landing page includes a citation that can be copied or downloaded in standard formats (BibTEX or EndNote). Connecting your data to your ORCID (see http://orcid.org/ ) also ensures that you get credit for your work. ORCID provides a persistent digital identifier that distinguishes you from every other researcher and supports automated linkages between you and your professional activities, ensuring that your work is recognized. The DataCite metadata template includes places to list ORCIDs of the creator. The DOI creation metadata template has a place for ORCIDs of creators and contributors. If you have published a paper that goes with your data, be sure to cite the DOI in the paper. Provide a link to the paper's DOI in the metadata under \"relatedIdentifier\". If your data includ specific instructions for citing or reuse, to provide those in the ReadMe file and (if brief) in the \"reuse_or_citation_conditions\" metadata field. Whom do I choose for the creator versus contributor? \u00b6 Creators are the main researchers involved in producing the data, or the authors of the publication, in priority order. To supply multiple creators, repeat this property. May be a corporate/institutional or personal name. The creator does not need to be the person who is submitting the identifier request. The institution or person responsible for collecting, managing, distributing, or otherwise contributing to the development of the resource. To supply multiple contributors, repeat this property. For software, if there is an alternate entity that \"holds, archives, publishes, prints, distributes, releases, issues, or produces\" the code, use the contributorType \"hostingInstitution\" for the code repository. You must include the role of all contributors. Choose from the dropdown list in the DOI request template. Which license can I use to publish my data? \u00b6 You can choose one of two open source licenses, depending on the materials you will be publishing: ODC PDDL for non-copyrightable materials (i.e., data only). CC0 for copyrightable material (Workflows, White Papers, Project Documents). If you have special circumstances that require a different license (e.g., your dataset is aggregated from previously published data that already has another license), please contact us at doi@cyverse.org . Can I make changes to the metadata record? \u00b6 Once the data is public it will not change, and thus metadata should be stable as well. However, it is possible that you may need to do minor edits or enhance the metadata. Version changes of the metadata will be recorded. To request changes to metadata data, contact us at doi@cyverse.org . What metadata standards does CyVerse support for data publication? \u00b6 All data will follow the DataCite metadata schema (currently using version 4.1). However, DataCite metadata is citation metadata that does not represent the complexity of the research that went behind creating your data. Therefore, we encourage you to include additional metadata. We suggest that you include the metadata records and other help documents in your publication package within a folder labeled as \"metadata\" so it is easily identifiable for other users. Consider taking advantage of the 's bulk metadata application feature for adding file level metadata, especially for large datasets. How can I organize and package my dataset for publication in the CyVerse Curated Data site? \u00b6 See the guidelines for organizing data for more details on how to prepare your data for publication. What if I want to change or add metadata to my public data? \u00b6 If you need to make changes to the metadata of a dataset with a DOI, contact us at doi@cyverse.org . If your dataset is connected to a paper that is published after the DOI is created, please contact us with the paper's DOI so we can link it in the metadata. Where can I go for help on permanent identifiers? \u00b6 Email the CyVerse DOI team .

Organize data \u00b6 There are several steps to properly organizing your dataset. These include determining what data to include, how many identifiers to request, how to organize the data into folders, and creating the ReadMe file and data inventory. 1.1. Determine what to include \u00b6 A data collection may be composed of multiple files and different datasets. In preparing your data for publication identify the data and other materials that you consider useful for validation and reuse of your research: Data associated to a research project may include multiple files with different roles. If there are components of your dataset that belong in a public repository such as NCBI (e.g., fastq files), submit them to the repository, rather than to CyVerse Curated Data. You may want to include a list of external files in your dataset, with links. Beyond data, you will include the ReadMe file (see Step 2.5), and you may include scripts or links to scripts to run your analysis. Links to analysis tools can also be included as metadata (see step 3). 1.2. Determine how many permanent identifiers to request \u00b6 To determine how many DOIs to request for a given data collection, consider the following: Size and number of components. How many studies or publications does it represent? Is your data collection formed by different datasets and are those likely to be used separately? Do you want to create a data collection with one DOI for the entire project and additional related DOIs for distinct datasets so that they are cited individually? DOIs can be nested, so that one dataset is part of another. If you are uncertain about how many DOIs to request, contact us at doi@cyverse.org . 1.3. Organize your data into folder(s) \u00b6 Organize your data so that there is one folder for each DOI, named according to step 2.4. Within a folder, include all files in your data package plus the ReadMe file and the inventory. You may have subfolders within a data package. You may include compressed files in a package, as described on the Permanent Identifier FAQs, but do not compress the entire folder/package. 1.4. Name your top level folder according to the guidelines \u00b6 The folder containing your dataset should be named using the $Creator_$subject_$date format. For more details on folder naming, see the CyVerse Curated Data Folder-Naming Guidelines . 1.5. Create a ReadMe file \u00b6 Create a text file labeled \"readMe\" with the following information: How you obtained, organized, and labeled your dataset. How to reuse the data, such as which apps can analyze the data. The inventory (see step 2.6) may be included as part of the readme file. Examples of good readme files: http://datacommons.cyverse.org/browse/iplant/home/shared/commons_repo/curated/Carolyn_Lawrence_Dill_G2F_Mar_2017/_readme.txt http://datacommons.cyverse.org/browse/iplant/home/shared/commons_repo/curated/Liang_Schnable_UNLPlantVision_2017/readMe.txt 1.6. Create an inventory \u00b6 You must create a plain text document that includes an inventory of the contents of the organized dataset (at a minimum, your dataset will contain one data file and one ReadMe file). The inventory may be part of the ReadMe file or a separate file. The inventory should include the ReadMe file and any other additional non-data materials you add to your dataset. If your dataset contains folders with many files (e.g., large collections of images), you do not need to list each file in the inventory. Simply describe the folder and what it contains. Describe the file naming conventions, if that is helpful. Example \u00b6 Lyons_DOI-Example-Aug2020: Top level directory name README.txt: Plain text file that describes the origin of the data, experiments, data processing, etc. Also contains a list and description for the contents of the top-level directory (unless a separate inventory file is provided) License.txt: License file (e.g., GPL, MIT) that governs the use of the data a.data1/: Directory containing data b.data2/: Directory containing more data c.data3/: Directory containing even more data d.analysis_graphs/: Results, graphs, analyses, and other good stuff Next Steps \u00b6 2) Add metadata 3) Submit request 4) After publication Additional information \u00b6 The UPenn library offers this guide to organizing data.

Question 1: Do you have a CyVerse account? \u00b6 Are you a registered CyVerse user? If not, register at user.cyverse.org . If so, have you used the Discovery Environment (DE)? The tools for submitting data to Data Commons Curated Data are simple to use and available as part of the DE. At a minimum, you should be able to upload and organize your data using the DE or iCommands , and be able to apply a metadata template . Question 2: Is your data ready for publication? \u00b6 Is the dataset complete, stable, and ready for public consumption? Are you and all contributors to the dataset prepared to move the data into the public domain (meaning that anyone can access and use the data for any purpose, including commercial purposes)? Have you sufficiently documented how the data was created such that other scientists in your field will be able to reuse it? If there is a standard or commonly used format for your datatype, is your data in that format? If no standard exists, is your data in a format that can be easily used by most people with open source software (e.g., tables as a CSV or text file, rather than a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet)? Is your data organized in a clear and reasonable structure that others will be able to understand? If you answered no to any of these questions, your dataset is not yet ready for a permanent identifier through Data Commons Curated Data. Please continue to work on your dataset until it meets these requirements. Before issuing a DOI, a CyVerse curator will review data to ensure that it meets these requirements. If you would like to make your data public, but it is not complete and/or stable, you may request data hosting in the Data Commons. Question 3: Is your data suitable for reuse in scientific analyses? \u00b6 Is your data of the type and format that allow it to be reused in other analyses? Are you prepared to supply metadata for your dataset? Does your dataset or metadata include sufficient instructions (e.g., a Readme file) such that someone in your field can understand how to reuse the data? Question 4: Is there a canonical repository for your data? \u00b6 Does a canonical repository exist for your data? Examples include NCBI, EBI, and MG-RAST. If a canonical repository exists, you should use it. CyVerse Data Commons Curated Data is there to help fill a gap, not replace an existing resource. If you answered No \u00b6 If you answered no to any of these questions, your data may be suitable for a DOI, but not through CyVerse Data Commons Curated Data.
